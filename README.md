# Energy-_Consumption_-Prediction
A deep learning–based system that predicts short-term, machine-level energy consumption in industrial settings. The project processes raw meter readings, forecasts usage using LSTM networks, and visualizes trends in an interactive dashboard. This enables industries to monitor performance, detect inefficiencies, and plan energy usage effectively.
